# Instructions to run the IoT Barrier Control System

## 1. Start the backend server

Open a terminal and navigate to the `backend` directory. Then run the following commands:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

## 2. Start the WebSocket server

Open another terminal and navigate to the `backend` directory. Then run the following command:

```bash
php artisan websockets:serve
```

## 3. Start the frontend server

Open a third terminal and navigate to the `frontend` directory. Then run the following command:

```bash
http-server
```

The frontend will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

## 4. Test the API

You can use the following `curl` command to test the API endpoint for sending telemetry data:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/access-logs -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"mac":"24A160123456","direcao":"NS","datahora":"2025-07-14 20:00:00","status":"AUTORIZADO"}'
```

## 5. Access the database

To access the database, you can use the following command:

```bash
mysql -u root -p laravel_barrier_control
```

Then, enter your password when prompted. Once you are connected, you can run SQL queries, for example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM telemetria;
```
