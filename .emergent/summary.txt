The previous AI engineer's work began with an initial brief for a Laravel-based gate access management system. The early phase involved environment setup, including dependency installation and database configuration. This phase faced challenges like missing  and  binaries, incorrect database service (attempting  instead of ), and  errors, which were resolved by installing necessary packages and correctly configuring MariaDB. A significant turning point was , where the user provided a highly detailed, comprehensive product specification, including fixes for existing issues (session driver, WebSocket 404, 405 errors) and complete code for new features (MAC address management, updated frontend, ESP32 logic). The AI engineer then systematically implemented these changes: fixing  and , creating and populating the  migration, model, and controller, and updating existing , , and  as per the user's detailed instructions. The last action was successfully running database migrations, indicating progress on schema updates.

<product_requirements>
The project aims to build an IoT-based Barrier Control System. It features hierarchical management (Companies, Sites, Barriers), flexible vehicle/permission assignment, and RBAC (SuperAdmin, CompanyAdmin, SiteManager). A key API endpoint allows ESP32 devices to verify vehicle authorization and log access attempts, enabling real-time barrier control based on LoRa AoA detection. The system includes an administrative interface for CRUD operations and real-time dashboard updates via WebSockets, displaying barrier status and vehicle movement. Critical features include MAC address management (add authorized MACs via API/UI), OTA firmware updates for ESP32, and a frontend simulation mode. The system needs fixes for a Laravel session driver 500 error and a WebSocket 404 error, and integration of the ESP32 code.

<pending_tasks>
- Full implementation of ESP32  on physical hardware (LoRa AoA, HTTP communication to backend).
- Ensure  table migration is applied (only  was explicitly shown to run).
- Comprehensive testing of the real-time  event flow from backend to frontend.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully set up the basic Laravel environment, resolved initial environment issues like missing PHP/Composer and database connection problems by installing dependencies and configuring MariaDB. Key backend bug fixes for Laravel's session driver (setting  in ) and WebSocket dashboard accessibility (disabling  middleware in ) have been implemented. A new core feature, Add Authorized MAC Address, has been fully integrated into the backend, including new migration, model, and controller, along with its API route (). The frontend's  now includes a dedicated form and JavaScript logic to interact with this new backend endpoint and has integrated Laravel Echo for WebSocket communication, though comprehensive testing of the real-time event flow is pending. The database schema for authorized MACs is updated and migrated.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Thoroughly test the new Add Authorized MAC functionality and verify real-time dashboard updates via WebSockets when simulated data is sent or actual ESP32 data arrives.
