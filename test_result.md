# Test Results for IoT Barrier Control System

## Original User Problem Statement
The project aims to build an IoT-based Barrier Control System. It features hierarchical management (Companies, Sites, Barriers), flexible vehicle/permission assignment, and RBAC (SuperAdmin, CompanyAdmin, SiteManager). A key API endpoint allows ESP32 devices to verify vehicle authorization and log access attempts, enabling real-time barrier control based on LoRa AoA detection. The system includes an administrative interface for CRUD operations and real-time dashboard updates via WebSockets, displaying barrier status and vehicle movement. Critical features include MAC address management (add authorized MACs via API/UI), OTA firmware updates for ESP32, and a frontend simulation mode. The system needs fixes for a Laravel session driver 500 error and a WebSocket 404 error, and integration of the ESP32 code.

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Instructions:
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure backend services are running and database is connected
2. **Test Coverage**: Focus on API endpoints, database operations, and core business logic
3. **Key Areas**: 
   - MAC address management (CRUD operations)
   - Access log creation and retrieval
   - WebSocket event publishing
   - Database migrations and model relationships
4. **Test Tools**: Use curl/httpie for API testing, verify database state
5. **Success Criteria**: All API endpoints respond correctly, data persists properly

### Frontend Testing Instructions:
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure frontend service is running and can access backend
2. **Test Coverage**: UI functionality, WebSocket connections, form submissions
3. **Key Areas**:
   - Dashboard real-time updates
   - MAC address addition form
   - WebSocket connectivity and event handling
   - Responsive design and user interactions
4. **Test Tools**: Browser automation, WebSocket connection testing
5. **Success Criteria**: All UI interactions work, real-time updates display correctly

### Communication Protocol:
- **Always read this file** before invoking testing agents
- **Update progress** in respective sections below
- **Report blockers** immediately if encountered
- **Verify fixes** before marking as complete

## Incorporate User Feedback
- **User Preference**: User indicated to continue with proposed plan
- **Testing Approach**: User will decide whether to test frontend manually or automated
- **Priority**: Focus on backend validation first, then frontend integration

## Environment Setup Status
- **PHP**: ✅ Installed (v8.2.28)
- **Composer**: ✅ Installed (v2.8.10)
- **MariaDB**: ✅ Installed and running
- **Laravel Dependencies**: ❌ Not installed yet
- **Supervisor Config**: ❌ Needs update for Laravel
- **Database Setup**: ❌ Needs configuration and migration

## Current Issues
1. **Supervisor Configuration**: Currently configured for Python/FastAPI, needs update for Laravel
2. **Database Migration**: Need to resolve duplicate macs_autorizados table creation
3. **Laravel Dependencies**: Need to run composer install
